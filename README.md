# Wake-up Light

The wake-up light emulates  alarm clocks like Philips' Wake-Up Light.

This is based upon Frans van Buul's [Wake-up Light][Wake-up Light].
I liked that it had a web gui to set alarms, but I wanted a real alarm clock, not the ceiling mounted light.

## Functions
Starting from the light and web ui, these were added:

- Four digit 7-segment LED display (TM1637)
- Adaptive intensity for the display
- I also wanted the web interface to have more of the feel of the standard Android alarm clock with multiple alarms
- Dark or light mode (select at compile time)
- Password required when changing alarms
- Easy Wifi set-up: no hard coded credentials
- Also added was a multi-function button:
    - turn off the alarm when activated
    - cycle through 3 light intensities
    - startup as an AP and WifiManager when held down at power-up
- NeoPixel or PWM as a light source, PWM can be inverted or non-inverted
- Plays mp3 file repeatedly when the alarm is active (Adafruit or Sparkfun MAX98357)

## Hardware
With all the added functionality, the number of exposed IO pins on an ESP-01 is not enough.
I used an Olimex MOD-WIFI-ESP8266, but any ESP-12 variant would probably do.
