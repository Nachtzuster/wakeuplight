/* This class implements the simple logic of dimming via PWM, without any alarm-like
 * functionality.
 * 
 * Setting the PWM dutycycle based on some value gives a linear control over the
 * resulting light intensity - but the human eye intensity response is more or less
 * logarithmic. This class contains the logic to compensate for that. The light
 * intensity can be set to a certain 'step'. This is converted to a PWM duty cycle such
 * that there experienced light intensity is roughly proportionate to the chosen step.
 * 
 * Methods off/decrease/increase/full are for manual control over light intensity. Method
 * 'increaseTo' is for automatic control during the wakeup cycle. The wake-up light functionality
 * will only increase light intensity, not decrease a previously manually set level. Hence
 * the 'increaseTo' rather than 'setTo' semantic.
 * 
 * This class also allows direct access to the PWM settings via 3 debug methods. This
 * is useful for circuit debugging, but is not used in the normal operations of the wake-up
 * light.
